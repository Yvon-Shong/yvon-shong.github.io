## Problem:

- my xsd and dtd are on the github.com. how can I refer them in xml?
- I will transfer this web to https://coding.net/u/yvonshong/p/xml_course/git to check the dtd and schema.
- in order to modufy the web of next.html to show our plan to sync this README.md, we will use the Pandoc to try to transfer the markdown file to html file.
- rebuild the xslt to process the movie.xml 

## Summary:

- iframe
iframe is hard to be adaptive and to modularize. and there are some errors of link jumping. nestification and modularization are hard by html.
- sync
    Git plus OneDrive are convenient for two computer which are used by the only one person.
    the editor for web like sublime text, vs code. I find the vs code integrate the Git.
- tools
    the online xml - xsl-fo -pdf transform  http://www.utilities-online.info/foprender/#
